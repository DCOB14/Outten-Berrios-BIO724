# Outten-Berrios BIO724
 Here you can find files and documents on my final project.

 ### Background
I am currently preparing for my first field season in Madagascar that is anticipated to be conducted late this summer in August/September. The primary objective of this study is to initiate unbiased quantitative research evidence on a non-profit’s community conservation initiatives and how it impacts fauna biodiversity. Before going to Madagascar, I plan to use previous rapid assessments data on lemurs, birds, and amphibians to analyze species richness, and density. So right now, I am trying to make a map that shows the previous transects’ observations by year and live animal trapping data and then use it to decide where to deploy camera traps, bioacoustics, and Sherman traps. Once this map is made, I will be trying to figure out how to compare these four different data types and determine the different capture rates for animal observation and analyze their effectiveness and cost. 
 

 ### Maps
 Under this section you will find various maps of the Manombo Special Reserve. This includes a basic map, and a transect map.

 ### Final Datas Scripts 
 Here will be final data scripts.
