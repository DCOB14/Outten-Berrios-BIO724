### Background
   In the past 20 years, Madagascar has experienced significant habitat loss with a 25% decrease in tree cover (4), moreover the effects of anthropogenic activities such as logging, hunting, mining, and slash-and-burn agriculture are compounded by the systemic issues of poverty and food insecurity (5). As Madagascar continues to experience these harmful human-wildlife interactions – exacerbated by the effects of climate change – community driven conservation strategies must be used to restore and retain valuable forest. Manombo Special Reserve (MSR) exemplifies many of the most damaging human-wildlife conflicts where its two forest fragments are surrounded by 31 human villages that heavily rely on forest resources. 
   Our research groups consist of teams at Duke University, Zoo New England, and Health In Harmony (HIH), an NGO focused on community-designed solutions to better protect tropical forests while improving human health. In 2019, HIH launched livelihood initiatives run by Malagasy clinicians, and scientists to provide affordable healthcare and sustainable agriculture education so that residents do not need to rely on the forests. The primary objective for my dissertation is to initiate unbiased quantitative research evidence for community conservation for HIH and residents. To mitigating the detrimental impact of human activities on the forest (6), HIH started a reforestation project in 2020(?) where they planted native trees and monitor it’s growth.  In addition to other research aims, for this first field season we will pilot a reforestation study that analyzes what animals utilize an immature forest over time. 


 ### Aims
I am currently preparing for my first field season in Madagascar that is anticipated to be conducted late this summer in August/September. The primary objective of this study is to initiate unbiased quantitative research evidence on a non-profit’s community conservation initiatives and how it impacts fauna biodiversity. Before going to Madagascar, I plan to use previous rapid assessments data on lemurs, birds, and amphibians to analyze species richness, and density. So right now, I am trying to make a map that shows the previous transects’ observations by year and live animal trapping data and then use it to decide where to deploy camera traps, bioacoustics, and Sherman traps. Once this map is made, I will be trying to figure out how to compare these four different data types and determine the different capture rates for animal observation and analyze their effectiveness and cost. 
 

 ### Maps
 Under this section you will find various maps of the Manombo Special Reserve. This includes a basic map, and a transect map.

 ### Final Datas Scripts 
 Here will be final data scripts.
